Why choose Ubuntu for Desktop?
The developersâ€™ choice
Using Ubuntu Desktop provides a common platform for development, test, and production environments.
Tools, such as Juju, Microk8s, and Multipass make developing, testing, and cross-building easy and affordable.
Long term support (LTS) releases are delivered every 2-years, with 5 years of standard support extended to 10 years with an Ubuntu Pro Desktop subscription.
New Developer editions of Ubuntu Desktop are released every 6-months, with 9-months of support and access to the latest kernel, libraries, and new upstream OS features.
